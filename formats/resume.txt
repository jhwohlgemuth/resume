SKILLS & EXPERIENCE
===================

Mathematics / Operations Research / Network Science
---------------------------------------------------
 * During my Masters studies, I studied Operations Research for over a year including the basics and a Python program to leverage genetic algorithms to solve a problem with no closed form solution.

Design / Development / Security
-------------------------------
 * As a BAE Systems principal engineer, consulted on multiple projects across BAE Systems and mentored developers on a daily basis
 * Created a [CLI tool to help create sustainable solutions with web technologies](https://github.com/jhwohlgemuth/tomo-cli). I maintain this project and leverage it to codify and share my knowledge in order to facilitate continued learning for me and others. 
 * Maintain security baseline by monitoring releases, reviewing changelogs, integrating version updates, submitting security impact analyses, and training co-workers on modern trends and technologies.

Training / Mentorship
---------------------
 * As a principal engineer at BAE Systems, developed and delivered [numerous presentations on web technology](https://github.com/jhwohlgemuth?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=slides&type=source&language=)

Engineering / General Management
--------------------------------
 * As a division officer on a submarine, supervised the daily operations of a nuclear reactor and engine room at sea and in port, maintaining electrical power to vital systems throughout the submarine.
 * Led teams through complex technical evolutions, during maintenance and casualty situations, maximizing efficiency while maintaining a safe environment.
