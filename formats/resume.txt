SKILLS & EXPERIENCE
===================

Mathematics, Operations Research, and Data Science
--------------------------------------------------
 * During my Master's studies, I studied Operations Research for over a year including the basics and a Python program to leverage genetic algorithms to solve a problem with no closed form solution.
 * My Master's thesis was an original topic of my own conception and **leveraged network analysis** to analyze small world networks created from Facebook data. See [publications section](#publications-citations).
 * As a developer, I have years of experience working with geospatial visualization technology.  I am a [CesiumGS/cesium contributor](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md).

Design & DevSecOps
------------------
 * Team lead well versed in Agile methodologies and experienced with developing and deploying software via an iterative process focused on speed and [sustainability](http://sustainable.surge.sh/).
 * At USSTRATCOM, designed a visual grammar in order to create detailed process documentation. The documentation is intended to help **architect sustainable solutions** in an effort to improve efficiency and mission readiness. Efforts directly contributed to **data modernization** of division.
 * As a BAE Systems principal engineer, consulted on multiple projects across BAE Systems and mentored developers on a daily basis
 * Created a [CLI tool to help create sustainable solutions with web technologies](https://github.com/jhwohlgemuth/tomo-cli). I maintain this project and leverage it to codify and share my knowledge in order to facilitate continued learning for me and others. 
 * **Maintain security baseline** by monitoring releases, reviewing changelogs, integrating version updates, submitting security impact analyses, and training co-workers on modern trends and technologies.

Training & Mentorship
---------------------
 * As a principal engineer at BAE Systems, developed and delivered [numerous presentations on web technology](https://github.com/jhwohlgemuth?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=slides&type=source&language=)
 * As a Command Training Team officer liaison, guided the planning and implementation of new training practices and procedures that included achieving 100% compliance with new Navy SAPR training guidance.
 * Maintained 100% readiness as the branch Training Officer ensuring that personnel were always ready to meet mission objectives.
 
 > Naturally, I use web technology to create my presentations (ex: [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) and [Spectacle.js](https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/))

Engineering & General Management
--------------------------------
 * As a division officer on a submarine, supervised the daily operations of a nuclear reactor and engine room at sea and in port, maintaining electrical power to vital systems throughout the submarine.
 * Led teams through complex technical evolutions, during maintenance and casualty situations, maximizing efficiency while maintaining a safe environment.
